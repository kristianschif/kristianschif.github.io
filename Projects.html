		<p class="projectTitleFormat">This Website</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">This has been one of the most intense projects I have ever worked on. The inspiration to put together a personal website arose from my summer 2017 internship with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. One of my tasks (discussed in the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation section) was to design and implement a SharePoint site for the Blades Product Center. This required that I become familiar with several different programming languages that I had never worked with before; including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I decided to put my new knowledge to the test and design a website that could showcase my work, interests, and skills I have acquired over the years.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">The website utilizes a responsive grid-system infrastructure called Bootstrap to facilitate web design for both desktop and mobile devices. In simple terms, the website will look appealing on both mobile and desktop platforms. Try it out! Adjust the browser window size on your desktop computer and the website will respond accordingly.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Aside from the linked Bootstrap files, the entire website was developed from homemade code. This has been the most extensive programming project I had ever worked on. Sample HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is displayed below.</p>

			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project0Image2.png"></img><p class="caption">Sample JavaScript</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Take it from me, you learn a great deal about yourself when you spend countless hours tirelessly working on code at your computer. However, in the end, the reward of completing such a project makes it worth while. I hope that this website can demonstrate my ability and willingness to step out of my comfort zone and take on complicated projects of any kind. At the very least, my ability to effectively use Google to troubleshoot problems and solutions must be made apparent.</p>

		<p class="projectTitleFormat">Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">During my four internships with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, I have been an integral part in many different projects. Given the nature of the company, I am unable to discuss each of these projects at length. However, I will provide a general overview of several different initiatives Iâ€™ve been involved in.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project1Image0.jpg"></img><p class="caption">Igor Sikorsky Statue</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat bold">Raw Material Automation</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">The goal of this project was to propose a solution for composite raw material handling and storage of the Blades Product Center. The solution must ensure that all composite raw material in the freezer and on the shop-floor is conforming to company and industry specifications to minimize potential escapes; lowering costs associated with expired and nonconforming material. The team I worked with successfully benchmarked three different software solutions in the composite tracking and nesting industry. Based on user experience with the software, a proposal has been developed for the approval of upper management to implement a new kiosk system onto the shop-floor.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat bold">Mistake Proofing</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">During the summer of 2017, the Quality team started a project initiative to discover and develop preventative measures for recurring issues within the Blades Product Center. The goal of this project was to develop a step-by-step mistake proofing process that the entire product center would utilize. For roughly a month, the Quality team met, brainstormed, and developed a standardized procedure that all employees could seamlessly implement. The result of our efforts was superb; a standard work that was easy to follow and provided users with powerful tools such as 5-Whys and Fishbone Diagram. Through this Root Cause and Corrective Action (RCCA) approach, the Blades Product Center has been able to uncover and resolve many of the recurring discrepancies the center faces.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat bold">Work-in-Progress (WIP) Inventory Reduction Effort</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">During my summer 2017 internship, I assisted a coworker with the task of tracking and minimizing all work-in-progress (WIP) at the Blades Product Center. At the initiation of this project back in 2015, it was discovered that the product center was housing several million dollars' worth of inventory that was both unaccounted for and stuck in production. The project focused on developing a Microsoft Access database to identify all of the WIP inventory that existed in the center so action could be taken to progress it through production. With inventory dating back to 2014, a great deal of data mining was required to identify each piece of inventory and their respective statuses to clear them for production. From our efforts, we were able to substantially reduce the WIP Inventory by roughly 50% its original value; saving the company a large sum of money.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat bold">SharePoint Site for Blades Product Center</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Last summer, I successfully developed a comprehensive SharePoint site to improve connectivity and infrastructure within the Blades Product Center. This tool provides employees with a central repository for important documentation, allows for enhanced reporting, and eases the friction that arises from cross-discipline information sharing. Today, the site is heavily used by employees to assist with everyday functions and processes that were previously reliant on a disorganized share drive infrastructure. This has increased the communication and connectivity within the center between the different disciplines.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat bold">Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">On July 31, 2017, I acquired my official Six Sigma Green Belt Certification from Lockheed Martin based on my training, expertise, and involvement with six sigma methodologies within the corporation. The following needed to be completed in order for me to achieve the certificate:</p>
		<ul class="projectSummaryList">
			<li>Active participation in the initiation, execution, and completion of two (2) lean/six sigma accredited events.</li>
			<li>Sixteen (16) hours of classroom training.</li>
			<li>Completion of all required online learning modules.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="projectSummaryFormat bold">Process Feedback Management Tool</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">In the summer of 2016, I was co-leader of the Process Feedback Management team in an effort to design a replacement system for an outdated UTC software across Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems. The team collected and analyzed all of the requirements for such a software, then put together a proposal for IT to develop. Today, the software is used to manage cross-discipline process discrepancies across the enterprise.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat bold">Automation of Clerical Work using VBA</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">During my internships, I have been given several different responsibilities that involve performing regular clerical work. Personally, I am not one to be thrilled when it comes to doing the same task over and over again, especially when it takes a substantial amount of time. Therefore, I set out to automate each of these processes using Visual Basic (VBA). Once programmed, I reduced the total time performing these tasks from roughly 20 mins to under 10 seconds. These programs saved coworkers and myself a great deal of time daily.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="project2" class="projectContent hide">
		<p class="projectTitleFormat">United Technologies (UTC) Senior Design</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">For my senior design project I am partnered with three electrical engineers, three mechanical engineers, and one other MEM student to solve an issue the UTC's Climate Control and Security (CCS) division is facing. The primary objective of this project is to investigate current technology and develop a means of weight detection for two different problems. Solutions to these issues will yield cost savings connected to energy waste, excessive manual labor, and overhead inefficiency.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project2Image0.png"></img><p class="caption"><span class="bold">Left to Right:</span> William Harasyko (MEM), Kristian Schif, Mousumi Roy (Advisor)</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">The first problem the company has asked us to investigate is the detection of mass within a refrigerated cargo truck. There is no cargo detection system currently in place to regulate the climate control system of these vehicles. The current control system is done manually by an inspector who determines whether to power the refrigerant system on or off. As it stands, the vehicles are similar to the a standard 48ft by 9ft by 8ft tractor trailer truck with built in climate control systems. Therefore, roughly 4704 ft3 must be controlled and kept within certain specifications, leading to high energy consumption. Currently, there is no Boolean weight detection system built-in to the vehicle. Hence, the system will often run at unnecessary times (e.g. empty during inspection or in transit to loading station).</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">The second problem we were tasked was to investigate a possible solution to detect fluid levels within CCS's fire suppression systems. The suppression tanks used in these systems need to be inspected biannually to ensure each tank has sufficient fluid levels. If the fluid level within a tank is reduced by 2.5% from the allowable value, it must be replenished to comply with specification. This current inspection process is both manual and extremely time consuming; weighing each of the tanks individually by detaching them from their respective hoses, lifting it onto a scale, and comparing the value to the one previously recorded. CCS is seeking to automate this process to improve the accuracy and mitigate the costs of this inspection.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">In December of 2017, based on preliminary research and experimentation, the team officially decided to pursue the fire suppression tank project. This project seeks to develop a working prototype that can accurately detect the mass contained within the enclosed fire suppression tanks. The phenomena of resonant frequencies has been investigated and tested to determine the current level within the tank. From experimentation, it has been discovered that the natural frequency of the entire system changes as the amount of fluid content fluctuates. This relationship was experimented on to derive a model that can output accurate information as to the fluid level within the tank.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project2Image1.png"></img><p class="caption">Process Map for Suppression Tank Device</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">The final deliverable of the project is to develop a mass sensing system prototype that can be implemented small scale. This system consists of a motor-controlled impact device that would induce vibrations of the tanks, a sonar sensor/audio-recorder that would sense the induced vibrations, a processing unit to analyze the frequency spectrum of the data, and a Bluetooth module that transmits the data to an Android mobile application. With such a system, CCS will be able to save both time and money on the current inspection process while having the capability to autonomously track the contents of its suppression tanks.</p>

		<p class="projectTitleFormat">Philanthropy & Community Service Projects</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">I am glad you have chosen to learn more about these projects as they are the ones I am the most pride of. Over the past three years, I have been extremely involved in the growth and development of philanthropic endeavors at the University of Connecticut. In the Spring 2017 semester, I was nominated for the Individual Community Service Award for my philanthropic and community service contributions within the university and the surrounding town of Mansfield.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project4Image0.jpg"></img><p class="caption">Community Service Award at the University of Connecticut</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">As a sophomore, I felt called to run for the philanthropy chair position of my fraternity because I wanted to expand our organization's efforts and have a valuable impact on the community. I was elected philanthropy chair for a year, where I worked hard to shape our values and improve all our efforts. As philanthropy chair, I successfully planned and executed six different philanthropy events, raising roughly $18,000 for a diverse set of charities and causes; including the Violence Against Women Prevention Program (VAWPP), Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), Wounded Warrior Project, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, These Hands Don't Hurt campaign, and the Women's Center at the University of Connecticut. Below showcases the many different philanthropy events I helped organize for Alpha Kappa Lambda.</p>

		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">During my time as philanthropy chair, I felt that there needed to be a position within the organization to organize and create community service opportunities for Alpha Kappa Lambda's members. Thus, I created and took on the new position of Community Service Chairman. I began this effort by beginning Alpha Kappa Lambda's Town of Mansfield Service Project. The purpose of this project was to give back to the surrounding community. Alpha Kappa Lambda was seeking to help aid surrounding neighborhoods in any way they may need. To my surprise, as many as 20 families responded to my flier in hopes that our organization could provide assistance with several different odd jobs. Over the last four years, our organization has given back over hundreds of service hours to the university and surrounding towns.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Following my time as Philanthropy Chairman, I was elected President of Alpha Kappa Lambda at the University of Connecticut. My efforts with this organization have had a lasting impact on how we operate and the values we uphold. It is truly an amazing feeling to know how far our organization has come and how it stands as a role model for others on campus today.</p>

		<p class="projectTitleFormat">Autonomous Transport Vehicle</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">During my summer 2016 internship with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, I participated in a company-wide engineering competition. Ten teams consisting of five engineers from different disciplines competed in the competition.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">The goal of the competition was to design an autonomous vehicle that could transport one gallon of water from Point A to Point B. The project seemed relatively easy at first until they introduced several different obstacles and design specifications:</p>
		<ul class="projectSummaryList">
			<li>The path that needed to be followed was made of a white LED strip. The LED strip eventually broke off into two pathways, one green and the other red. The Car needed to follow the Green LED strip.</li>
			<li>To adhere to the competitionâ€™s design specifications, the vehicle had to be very narrow and top-heavy.</li>
			<li>The vehicle could only use the two low torque DC motors that were provided.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">After a week of brainstorming, we put our ideas to work. We began by creating the vehicle's framework. The DC and Servo motors were then rigged to the vehicle. Following this, we began developing a rough circuit for the vehicle using Arduino components provided by the company. Shortly after, we hit our first milestone. The vehicle could travel in a straight line!</p>

			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project5Image1.jpg"></img><p class="caption">Early State Circuit and Configuration</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Although it seems like we were very far in the project, there was a great deal of work left to do. To track the LED strip, we designed an overhang at the front of the vehicle. The overhang was rigged with four photosensors; one on the far left, left of center, right of center and far right. The job of the photosensors was to act like a sweeper arm for the LED strip and realize when the vehicle was falling off course. When falling off course, commands would be sent to the servo motor to steer the vehicle in the right direction. After countless hours of trial and error, we had our vehicle working and ready to compete at the competition.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project5Image2.jpg"></img><p class="caption">Finished Product on Race Day</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">On race day, we came across several issues we had not considered when first designing our vehicle. Regardless of these challenges, our vehicle performed exceptionally well and placed fourth overall.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">This project has certainly been one of the most diverse and intricate ones I have ever been a part of. It is an excellent example of how a team can unite and utilize everyone's skillset to achieve a common goal.</p>

		<p class="projectTitleFormat">Homemade Two-Stroke Bicycle</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">I decided to experiment with a project unlike anything I had ever undertaken. The idea arose one day when I entered my garage, only to find a broken bicycle and broken weed wacker. Before my father could throw them away, I decided to turn one man's trash into another man's treasure. I perceived this as an opportunity to learn more about the mechanical nature of these items and set out to create a motorized bicycle.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">My first objective was to repair the bicycle back into a proper working condition. Since the bike frame was still intact, all I had to do was diagnose, repair and replace the broken parts to bring the bike back to life. After replacing the rear wheel rim, bike chain, and rear derailleur, the bicycle was working like new. To ensure its reliability, I took the bike for a few long distance trips across town.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Now that the bicycle was working, it was time for me to fix the broken STIHL FS80R 25cc Weed Wacker. At first, this was an extremely daunting task to set out and accomplish as I had never worked hands-on with engines in the past. I performed a great deal of research beforehand to understand the complexities of such machines. Before disassembling the engine, I performed a couple of tests to diagnose the different issues the motor had. The engine failed a compression test, yielding 50 psi upon startup (below the minimum allowable of 60 psi). Additionally, the engine failed an electricity test, therefore the ignition coil would need to be replaced. Upon disassembling the engine, it was further discovered that the piston assembly and cylinder were harshly damaged from debris and would need to be replaced. Once these issues were resolved, the engine performed like new.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project8Image0.jpg"></img><p class="caption">Repaired and Modified STIHL FS80R Engine</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">The next step was to develop a working design for the motorized bicycle. The plan was to transmit the torque of the motor to the rear wheel. To begin, a motor mount needed to be created at the rear of the bike. With the use of an arc welder and square metal tubing, a sturdy motor mount was rigged to bike. Now, with the clutch and flywheel adjacent to the rear wheel, the final step is to transmit the torque from the engine to the rear wheel.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project8Image1.jpg"></img><p class="caption">Motor Mounted to Rear Wheel of Bicycle</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Unfortunately, the project was cut short due to my return to school. The project will likely be complete during the winter intersession. In the meantime, several different solutions are being researched to transmit torque to the rear wheel.</p>

		<p class="projectTitleFormat">Reverse Engineering of RC Racecar</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">During my first semester freshman year, I was assigned a project in the Introduction to Engineering course I was enrolled in. The goal of the project was to have a team of four disassemble and reassemble a complex object. When brainstorming potential objects to reverse engineer, it dawned upon me that I owned a TACON RC Racecar that I used to race with my father that was not working properly. This project was the perfect opportunity to get to the root cause of this problem while learning a great deal about how cars work at a macro level.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project9Image0.jpg"></img><p class="caption">TACON RC Racecar Before Disassembly</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">As a team, we documented each disassembly step with pictures to ensure a successful reassembly. Along the way, we discovered the many different mechanisms that were involved in such a car. Eventually, we disassembled the rear axle gearbox only to discover the root cause of the vehicle's failure. The gear box had an excessive amount of contaminants (mostly dirt) that prevented the transfer of motion from the DC motor to the rear wheels. After a quick clean and reassembly, the vehicle was working like new.</p>

		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Our team's deliverable for the project was a PowerPoint over 100 slides in total, providing insight on all our findings. The professor enjoyed our project so much that he selected us to present the project to the entire lecture of roughly 500 students. This was a very interesting way to start off my college career.</p>

		<p class="projectTitleFormat">3D Printing Independent Research</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">As a sophomore, I was offered the opportunity to take the MEM3229 Independent Research course by the Management for Engineering and Manufacturing program coordinator. The deliverable for the course was to assemble, configure, and document the procedures for using an Afinitbot 3D Printer so it can be used by students for the MEM2212 course. I was paired up with a close friend of mine to take on this task.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">To our luck, the instruction manual was written entirely in Chinese, making the assembly process extremely cumbersome and complicated. Both Google and trial and error were our best friends throughout this process. Eventually, we had the skeleton of the printer ready to go for the electrical configuration stage.</p>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Unfortunately, as shown in the picture below, we experienced great difficulty setting up the circuit at first. There were instructions on which terminals to connect, however there were none on how to package the wires and electrical components on the printer.</p>
			<div class="imageContainer"><img class="image" src="images/project10Image0.jpg"></img><p class="caption">Early Circuit Board Configuration and Troubleshooting</p></div>
		<p class="projectSummaryFormat">Over time, my partner and I were able to perfect the configuration so it was both efficiently packed and aesthetically pleasing.
